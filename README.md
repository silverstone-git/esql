# esql
Pronounced e-sequel, this python program stores data in binary and lets you enter various queries to manipulate it, which makes up for a minimal dbms.

<b>INSTALLATION:</b>

1. For Windows, Mac OS, Linux or any Unix in which python interpreter is installed and is in the environment variables, just run the autorun.py with libesql.py and bison.py in the same fresh folder using the command prompt or terminal or try double clicking it or smth.

2. For Android specifically, if you are rooted and have python 2 or python 3 binary in terminal, rename the /system/*bin/ binary to “python2” or “python3”, but if you don’t have it,
Easier Method is to execute file from a 3rd party IDE from play store or use termux, give storage permissions to it, type “pkg install python” in the app, cd into the directory where you kept the 3 files and type “python autorun.py”
